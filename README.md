# Introduction
In this project, I explore techniques for cleaning and transforming data using SQL. Data cleaning is a critical step in the data preparation process, ensuring that the data we work with is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

# Background
This project was born from a desire to transform messy and inconsistent data into reliable data, enhance data quality, and facilitate more accurate analyses. The data sources for this project include an Audible Dataset obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains information about audiobooks available on Audible.in, providing details such as book titles, authors, genres, ratings, and more. By applying data cleaning techniques, I aim to transform raw, unstructured data into a clean and usable format, ready for further analysis or integration into other systems.

# What are the data quality improvements needed?
